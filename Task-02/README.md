This task was to build a text editor in C. As I am learning C in my college curriculum I had to learn some extra topics which were not covered in class and start with the task. Initially I felt it hard but after some days I managed to do it. For this task I took the help of a repo in github. By this task I got to learn C and get deep into it and the code was very long.
